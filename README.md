Async/Await (promise) practice

TODO
-Make times more human readable
-Refactor into seperate modules
-Submit input with "Enter" key
-Add ability to choose country
-create init function with default location
-add search by city name input (not as accurate)


BUGS
-Sunrise/Sunset times are displayed in users local time
--this is likely due to the new Date() function being called and returning local time
