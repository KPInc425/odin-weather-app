Async/Await (promise) practice

TODO

-Add api fetch for forecast and display it
-Add ability to choose country
-add search by city name input (not as accurate)
-Use daytime/nighttime in giphy fetch
-Find some gif search term to corrolate with weather descriptions



BUGS
-Sunrise/Sunset times are displayed in users local time
--this is likely due to the new Date() function being called and returning local time
